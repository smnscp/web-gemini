# Gemini Game Web App
A board game I fell in love with and wanted to get it in my browser.

## Disclaimer
I am **not** the inventor of that game and do **not** own the copyright for it. I only wrote this software implementation.

## The Original
The board game _Gemini_ was created by Dr. Oliver Schaudt and is manufactured by Gerhards Spiel und Design. If you like this software version you will love [the hardware version](https://www.spielewerkstatt.eu/de/startseite/177-gemini.html).

## How to Play
* Move the marbles along straight lines.
* Only two neighboring marbles can be moved together.
* The puzzle is solved once all marbles of the same color (except for the white placeholder marbles) lie in straight rows.
